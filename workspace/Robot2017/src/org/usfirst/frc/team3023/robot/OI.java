//// CREATING BUTTONS
// One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a joystick.
// You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
// number it is.
// Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
// Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);

// There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
// by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
// commands the same as any other Button.

//// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
// Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
// three ways:

// Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
// button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());

// Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
// the button is released.
// button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());

// Start the command when the button is released and let it run the command
// until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
// button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
